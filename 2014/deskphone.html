  	<h1>Desk phone</h1>
  	<time datetime="2014-03-06 19:12">March 6, 2014</time>
  	<p>I am working from home, attending a conference call, while on mute the whole time. But just around the time I un-mute to say something, the cuckoo clock in the living room, which isn&rsquo;t far from my study, goes off &mdash; forcing me to scramble for the software mute button. It&rsquo;s surprising the number of times this happens to me. I could get rid of the clock, but given the adoration it receives from my wife, that would be unwise.</p>
<p>In another scene, I am in an open office environment, and I am taking a call (because we use internet telephony, of course), and my gentle co-workers happen to be taking theirs too. I could use a meeting room, but it&rsquo;s a hassle: pre-book a room, undock notebook, hand-carry with headphones and power cable along, temporarily lose network connectivity and power, etc., reconnect, fumble with wires, et al. Other times with multiple audio I/Os, the hardware gets confused. Sometimes the notebook&rsquo;s speaker suddenly comes to life, other times, it&rsquo;s the USB headset. Being blessed with a headphone + mic jack also on my office notebook, I could get rid of the USB headset, but there&rsquo;s a catch of course: If I leave it connected, I won&rsquo;t get audio alerts from the notebook&rsquo;s speaker; every sound then goes to the headset instead.</p>
<p>The thing I liked best about IP phones was that they were designed to answer calls. With those now removed from desks, due to no-fixed-desk open-floor corporate policy &mdash; designed to improve occupancy to desks ratio, answering calls has become a chore. Also, I dislike chat programs. They are a distraction, and their &lsquo;answer now, or you&rsquo;re impolite&rsquo; hustle makes me mad. I am willing to give one channel the immediacy &mdash; either a phone or a chat program, likely the former, but not both. In practice however, one needs to keep the chat-on on tools like Office Communicator, else one won&rsquo;t receive a call; all of this has gotten completely out of hand.</p>
<p>Using clumsy headphones is no way to receive calls. I often end up dropping things to take the call &mdash; sometimes because it is important, and in doing so, the usual fumble to plug headphones in a desperate attempt not to lose the call ensues. I realized I needed a decent telephony hardware to do simple things easily (call, hang-up, mute, and toggle volume) on occasions I can avoid the headset. Plus, it needed to be portable that can go in my backpack. From searching for a speakerphone, I found <a href="http://www.jabra.com/products/pc_headsets/jabra_speak__510_series/jabra_speak_510_ms">Jabra Speak 510</a>, which appears designed to do what I want from such a device. The catch: it isn&rsquo;t available where I live, and so I am forced to order it from overseas. I hope to receive one soon.</p>
<p>Update (Mar 20): It&rsquo;s been a few days since I received the <a href="http://www.jabra.com/products/pc_headsets/jabra_speak__510_series/jabra_speak_510_ms">speakerphone</a>, and I&rsquo;ve had a chance to test it as part of my work routine &mdash; I have a soft phone number, and for personal calls, I use my iPhone. The speakerphone automatically sets itself to be the default speaker device in Windows 7 for the soft phone (via the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communicationsserver/en/au/office-communicator.aspx">Office Communicator</a>, or <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/lync/">Lync</a>), which is nice, i.e., users without administrative rights will appreciate this no-settings-needed device. Once mated, it automatically connects to my iPhone via bluetooth. So this really is one speakerphone for two phones.</p>
<p>The other day my daughter called while out for shopping with her mom, and I put her on the speakerphone. Hearing her voice, my father, who was in the living room, asked if she was back home so soon, and I said I was speaking to her on the phone. That I think is a reasonable attestation of how good and clear the speakerphone really is. </p>
