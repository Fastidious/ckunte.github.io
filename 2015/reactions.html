  	<h1>Mapping dynamics</h1>
  	<time datetime="2015-07-11 21:55">July 11, 2015</time>
  	<p>While sifting through some of my files yesterday, I found a spread-sheet using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination" title="Gaussian elimination">Gaussian elimination</a> technique, refreshing old memories. In 2004, we were engineering a spar + topside &mdash; the first of its kind for the region. For transport, we designed the topside to straddle atop two lean barges &mdash; like a catamaran. This enabled the topside to be floated over, and mate with the spar. (Image courtesy: Offshore Kinematics Inc. OTC 19639 paper offers more details on installation.)</p>

<p>We quickly realized that the catamaran arrangement was a stiffness hog for the topside during tow (racking moments resulting from quartering seas) &mdash; driving the need for more steel in the topside, far more than in its in-service conditions. (Michael Luo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US8312828">US 8312828 B2</a> patent titled, &ldquo;Pre-loading to reduce loads and save steel on topsides and grillage of catamaran systems&rdquo; describes the measures we took to save steel.)</p>
<p>Marine team furnished motion-induced dynamic loads of the catamaran barge ensemble (from motion responses) for  topside stress check during its fourteen-day tow. To transfer these on to the topside as inertia loads, we did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we converted the dynamic loads into topside coordinate system along with sign conventions.</li>
<li>Then, we generated inertia loads on topside corresponding to 1.0&sdot;g of linear (surge, sway, heave) and angular accelerations (roll, pitch, yaw), which resulted in a load case each &mdash; six in total, with each containing loads (Fx, Fy, Fz) and moments (Mx, My, Mz).</li>
<li>From the two above, the idea was to get suitable factor to apply to the loads generated in step 2 to match the dynamic loads received from the Marine team &mdash; using the Gaussian elimination technique.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon solving the following grid, we&rsquo;d end up with six load factors to multiply with our set of six inertia load sets respectively.</p>
<pre><code>+-                                 -+
| Fx1  Fx2  Fx3  Fx4  Fx5  Fx6 | Fx |
| Fy1  Fy2  Fy3  Fy4  Fy5  Fy6 | Fy |
| Fz1  Fz2  Fz3  Fz4  Fz5  Fz6 | Fz |
| Mx1  Mx2  Mx3  Mx4  Mx5  Mx6 | Mx |
| My1  My2  My3  My4  My5  My6 | My |
| Mz1  Mz2  Mz3  Mz4  Mz5  Mz6 | Mz |
+-                                 -+

<p>Back to the spreadsheet, I noticed that we had actually generated a multiple pivot-eliminate routines through iterations, until all coefficients (except the principal diagonal) were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition" title="Lower Upper decomposition">decomposed</a>, and coefficients in the principal diagonal contained 1 each &mdash; as is done in the technique. </p>
<p>Matrices are now available in most modern computing software. Gaussian elimination, on the other hand, was perhaps from an era of logarithms and radians &mdash; designed to simplify computational complexity when done by hand. So, I am not sure why we used this technique, in lieu of matrix functions in Excel or MathCAD available at our disposal.</p>
<p>Following the classic recipe of solving linear equations (<code>A . x = B</code>) for x, a column matrix of load factors, where <code>A</code> is a square matrix of inertia loads &mdash; corresponding to 1.0&sdot;g, and <code>B</code> is a column matrix of dynamic loads from catamaran&rsquo;s motion responses, I punched in the two arrays to see if I could get the same set of <code>x</code>. Here&rsquo;s how simple it is with <code>numpy</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
&quot;&quot;&quot;
mat.py -- 2015 ckunte.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
import numpy

def main():
    # Inertia matrix, A, corresponds to 1.0g in surge, sway, 
    # heave, roll, pitch, and yaw.    
    A = numpy.mat(&quot;[-11364.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -412.3, -9.1; \
        0.0, -11364.0, 0.0, 412.3, 0.0, -9.9; \
        0.0, 0.0, -11364.0, 9.1, 9.9, 0.0; \
        0.0, 231661.7, 5129.7, -11569.7, 322.5, 266.6; \
        -231661.7, 0.0, 5574.3, 322.5, -15050.3, -239.8; \
        -5129.7, -5574.3, 0.0, 266.6, -239.8, -8929.5]&quot;)
    # Motion-induced dynamic loads (one of numerous cases)
    B = numpy.mat(&quot;[-2961.0; -1358.0; -40613.0; 119921.5; \
    -68588.5; 210347.9]&quot;)
    # getI() is the matrix inverse function from numpy.
    x = A.getI() * B
    print x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
