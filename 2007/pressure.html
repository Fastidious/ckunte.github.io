  	<h1>Pressure</h1>
  	<time datetime="2007-05-21 23:10">May 21, 2007</time>
  	<p>Shower is running cold and it wakes you up like no alarm has ever managed. We are approaching summer, but it&rsquo;s still freezing. </p>
<p>I check the boiler. AGPO Ferroli Econoforte HMA32 is a fancy setup with an unfamiliar reading on display: <code>E.01</code>. I am able to guess that it&rsquo;s an error code about which, wife and I have no idea. I search for the manual in the attic and hallelujah, it&rsquo;s in Dutch. No time for translation because it&rsquo;s 8:30am and I am running late for work.</p>
<p>Wife later calls the AGPO hotline. The other end, I&rsquo;m told, is friendly, says it&rsquo;s a simple fix but can&rsquo;t explain the how-to in English. We decide not to try anything foolish, because the system looks like a black-box, unconventional, Dutch labels, et al. Instead, we call our official maintenance. They promise to get somebody to call us for an appointment. So here we are.</p>
<p>In the end nobody calls. Wife continues to phone the official maintenance. The phone rings and then auto-redirects to voice-mail. This process is now on a loop. By afternoon, the entire home temperature has dropped by another 2&deg;C. We haven&rsquo;t heard from anyone yet and it is now evening. We&rsquo;re now worried about the temperature drop at night, and that kids may not be able to sleep well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now 7 in the evening. </p>
<p>I translate the error code from Dutch to English. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;water intake error.&rdquo; Not enough pressure apparently. The needle needs to be in the green zone &mdash; above 1 bar. We mention it to our neighbour. He comes up, looks at the set-up and says that the sump needs water, adding that it could also be potentially clogged. Together we unscrew those odd-looking closure valves and pump water into the sump, which looks like an LPG gas cylinder, and which is why wife and I didn&rsquo;t touch it in the first place. With the refill the code changes automatically and the boiler&rsquo;s familiar hum is back. We&rsquo;re relieved; thank Eric for saving us from cold. All is well again.</p>
<p>It happens about twice a year we&rsquo;re told, possibly due to differential temperatures leading to vaporization of water from the sump. We now know what to do the next time around.</p>
