  	<h1>The Dark Sky Project</h1>
  	<time datetime="2020-01-07 19:05">January 7, 2020</time>
  	<p>We had an early supper on 27 December in preparation for an appointment at the <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/subjects/astronomy/" title="Astronomy | University of Canterbury">University of Canterbury&rsquo;s</a> Mt John Observatory. With wind speeds in excess of 80kph on Mt John that night we were cautioned that the tour could potentially get cancelled. After waiting for a bit, with a clear sky and reduced intensity, the team decided it was safe to be on the summit for the next couple of hours, and soon a bus-full of hopefuls boarded.</p>
<p>Guided by the university&rsquo;s researchers, <a href="https://www.darkskyproject.co.nz/tours/summit-experience/" title="Summit Experience at Mt John Observatory - Dark Sky Project">The Dark Sky Project</a> offers an information-rich star-gazing experience. One of the researchers offered setting my daughter&rsquo;s SLR up to capture the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way - Wikipedia">Milky Way</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux" title="Crux - Wikipedia">Southern Cross</a>, and a dying star. I had thought this wasn&rsquo;t possible without a telescope!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s educational to note that the tour is as much about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution" title="Light pollution - Wikipedia">light pollution</a> as it is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" title="Astronomy - Wikipedia">Astronomy</a> 101. In the words of <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/11/light/falling-in-love-with-the-dark" title="Falling in Love With the Dark - Issue 11: Light - Nautilus">Dr Tyler Nordgren</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re losing the stars. Think about it this way: For 4.5 billion years, Earth has been a planet with a day and a night. Since the electric light bulb was invented, we&rsquo;ve progressively lit up the night, and have gotten rid of it. Now 99 percent of the population lives under skies filled with light pollution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To best appreciate this problem, I highly recommend reading <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/11/light" title="Issue 11: Light - Nautilus">Nautilus&rsquo;s Issue 11: Light</a>. With so much light pollution, scientists and astronomers are finding it increasingly difficult to make scientific observations and discoveries. Why does it matter? It&rsquo;s because the nights have helped progress science, discover where we are in the universe, appreciate our uniqueness, what&rsquo;s surrounding us, what&rsquo;s coming at us and when, realise that we&rsquo;re actually seeing the past of stars as their light takes years to reach us, and historically helped us develop an understanding of the laws of physics by <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ckunte/structural-dynamics">observing other planets</a>.</p>
<p>I hope more of us realise that we are indeed losing our beautiful starry night skies, but with a little effort, much can be regained. The University of Canterbury has convinced the residents surrounding Mount John the detrimental effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_visible_light" title="High-energy visible light - Wikipedia">HEV light</a>. As a result the whole town spreads a subtle, low pale yellow light in a non-polluting manner at night, which is a wonderful demonstration of care &mdash; for the environment, for public health, for their nocturnal animals, not to mention for the researchers, all the while consuming less energy.</p>
<p>Of the many tours in <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/" title="Welcome to New Zealand | Official site for Tourism New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, this is the one I liked most. It&rsquo;s convincing even if one is not remotely interested in Astronomy. All one needs is an open mind.</p>
