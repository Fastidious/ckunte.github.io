<blockquote>
<p>When an engineer becomes a lead or a manager, they create a professional satisfaction gap. They&rsquo;ve observed this gap long before they became a lead with the question: &ldquo;What does my boss do all day? I see him running around like something is on fire, but&hellip; what does he actually do?&rdquo; The question gets personal when the now freshly minted manager begins to understand that life as a lead is an endless list of little things that collectively keep you busy, but, in aggregate, don&rsquo;t feel much like progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a brilliant post on why personal growth and development needs firm commitment and follow through hands-on work out of your personal (out of office) time. </p>
<p>Chasing the zone, I am often distracted enough both at work as well as at home with the immediacy of things that cannot seem to wait another minute in order to find my one hour a day so I could build something. Fortunately, I have a personal list of things I want to build, and I am pretty much sold on its value, and what it does to my learning. </p>
<p>Finding an hour after what looks like a typical burnout day is going to be hard. I am able to find a couple of hours over the weekend &mdash; rested and ready to take-on, while the rest of my family is still in bed. But I have come to the conclusion that waiting for doing things over the weekend is just too little or too late.</p>
