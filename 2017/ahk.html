  	<h1>Hotkeys</h1>
  	<time datetime="2017-05-18 20:11">May 18, 2017</time>
  	<p>Three months ago, I began using my Logitech G610 keyboard at work to avoid managing KVM hygiene everyday &mdash; side-effect of a hot-desking policy. It is a fine, if hefty, full-sized keyboard, and that became a problem. I mean at the end of every work day, I&rsquo;d unplug to shove it inside a 1&rsquo;-0&rdquo;&times;1&rsquo;-0&rdquo; locker, leaving very little usable room for anything else.</p>
<p>Not wanting to buy yet another, I pulled my seldom-used Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard out. This in many ways is worse than its large, corded sibling. For the portability you inherit its handicap of missing keys &mdash; some of them critical to be productive; this aside from the prospect of blowing one&rsquo;s mind with jumbled hotkeys across OSes &mdash; Mac at home; Windows at work.</p>
<p>To recover sanity, I looked at ways to remap keys so I could use Mac hotkeys on Windows, and found <a href="https://autohotkey.com/" title="AutoHotkey">AutoHotkey</a> promising. As a general scripting tool, however, there is no way around the manual, and it so took me a good few trial and error compiles to get to a set of <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/mackeyboard" title="ckunte/mackeyboard: Mac keyboard to Windows key mappings">usable hotkey mappings</a>. I then compiled <em>mackeyboard.ahk</em> script together with a &#x2318; key icon to generate <em>mackeyboard.exe</em> file.</p>
<p>It runs just fine in the background capturing all my hotkeys pressed in Mac-style and transforming them into Windows hotkeys on the fly. </p>
<h2>Text expansion</h2>
<p>Not to be done with hotkeys, it also works great as a text expander, saving me some repetitive typing. Here is an example. </p>

  <figcaption>Custom preamble is prepared in a reply email using sender's firstname for salutation when I hit the key combination <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> after selecting a message in my Inbox.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The AutoHotkey code I use to auto-produce the above is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>; In Microsoft Outlook only
#IfWinActive ahk_class rctrl_renwnd32

!x::
ol := COMObjActive("Outlook.Application").ActiveExplorer.Selection.Item(1)
From := ol.SenderName
StringGetPos, pos, From, `,
if errorlevel
{
    StringGetPos, pos, From, %A_Space%
    StringLeft, From, From, pos
}
else
{
    StringTrimLeft, From, From, pos+2
}
StringUpper From, From, T
FirstName := RegExReplace(From, " .*", "")
SendInput, ^+r
Sleep, 100
SendInput, Hi %FirstName%, {Enter 2}Thank you for your email.{Enter 2}
Return

#IfWinActive
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>IfWinActive</code> enclosure ensures that this hotkey (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>) is only triggered when Microsoft Outlook is the active window. This is enabled by <code>ahk_class</code>, which for Microsoft Outlook happens to be <code>rctrl_renwnd32</code>. Since I began working on this afresh, I had to figure out the application class for AutoHotkey to work. I have <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/mackeyboard" title="ckunte/mackeyboard: Mac keyboard to Windows key mappings">identified</a> a few for some common applications. There are a few nuggets like these in the repository. Do check them out.</p>
<p>Digressing into Mac territory, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to do this above in Apple Mail with <a href="https://textexpander.com/" title="TextExpander – Productivity App">TextExpander</a> app together with a sprinkling of AppleScript and a text expansion trigger.</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Mail"
    set selected to selection
    set msg to item 1 of selected
    set sentBy to (sender of msg)
    "Hi " &amp; word 1 of sentBy &amp; ",\n\nThank you for your email."
end tell
