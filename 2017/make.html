  	<p>Returning from the Tamara, Coorg last week, my only vacation this year, I knew my following week would be nothing short of a back-breaking stone quarry work. So on Monday, just as I was about to get-on, my otherwise reliable work notebook began flashing BSOD. Post frantic calls to IT help-desk, they dispatched a helpful hardware engineer at running speed. He patiently went through system diagnostics and in the end said it&rsquo;s software, which requires a wipe + re-image routine. I lifted my hands up in exasperation, thinking about my planned work week that just got flushed. </p>
<p>The good thing is that on any given day, I am fully backed-up and up to speed. Ten years ago when I got hit by a bad crash, I vowed to never let this happen to me again. So, everyday my scripts run for about ten minutes before I call it a day, differentially backing everything-up with the ever reliable <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/" title="rsync">rsync</a>. So when he asked if I needed more time to manage my data on disk, I said no, and that he should continue. The engineer then proceeded to re-image my machine. Here&rsquo;s the thing though, and I am trying very hard not to swear, the official images are <em>never</em> up to speed! This makes any freshly re-imaged machine all but usable for the next 48 hours, as auto-downloading updates and profiled software, punctuated by countless reboots, completely consumes the computer. It&rsquo;s often longer as these down-the-wire updates need the corporate hose.</p>
<p>While waiting for my machine to be back on its feet, my thoughts wandered around about the backup routine, the tools I&rsquo;ve been using, and our pleasant stay at the Tamara. Then I remembered merging a pull request from a contributor, while still on vacation, who wrote a helpful <code>Makefile</code> for my repo. Inspired by this, and by <a href="http://matthias-endler.de/2017/makefiles/" title="Afraid of Makefiles? Don't be! - Matthias Endler">Endler&rsquo;s wonderful post</a>, I thought of making one for all my backup/restore routines too, which would simplify my scattered backup shell scripts into just one <code>Makefile</code>. So, I <a href="https://gist.github.com/ckunte/d57ed8ae8c13315416ac22b83ba1ac7c" title="My Makefile for backups">wrote one</a> this week.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>Makefile</code> is fussy about its format: (a) Tabs only (no spaces!) of indent-size 4; and (b) No in-line comments to ensure predictable behaviour.</p>
<p>Now instead of running different shell scripts, I just have to run <code>make backup</code> (or <code>time make backup</code> to also know the time taken) or <code>make restore</code> (or <code>time make restore</code>) in the terminal and be done with it. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/ckunte/d57ed8ae8c13315416ac22b83ba1ac7c" title="My Makefile for backups">Makefile</a> also can run only select pre-defined folders, e.g., I can only choose to backup current projects with <code>make curr</code>, and so on. If I run only <code>make</code>, then it offers these options:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
Makefile for backup and restore routines

Usage:
    make backup    backup all mail projects references
    make restore   restore all mail projects references
    make mail      backup all mail
    make proj      backup all projects
    make curr      backup only current projects
    make past      backup only past projects
    make ref       backup all references
    make cref      backup only current references
    make pref      backup only past references
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>time</code> option (as in <code>time make backup</code>), <code>5:44.57</code> in the example below is the real (clock) time (listed in mm:ss.ms in this example) the job takes to complete.</p>
<pre><code>sent 1,382,904,905 bytes  received 118 bytes  4,014,238.09 bytes/sec
total size is 4,753,411,072  speedup is 3.44
make mail  17.20s user 48.51s system 19% cpu 5:44.57 total
</code></pre>
<p>This downtime gave me a pause, and an opportunity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a> my workflow simpler, which I think isn&rsquo;t bad at all.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> If one has symlinks with name same as the command in make file (e.g., if one has <em>curr</em> symlink in the same folder as <em>Makefile</em>), then <code>rsync</code> says <code>curr</code> is up to date, even if source and destination <code>curr</code> folders are not identical! To avoid this error, ensure symlink names are not identical to make commands in <em>Makefile</em>. Alternatively add it to <code>.PHONY</code> list.</p>
