  	<h1>Release notes</h1>
  	<time datetime="2021-02-21 15:04">February 21, 2021</time>
  	<p>The publishing mechanism used to produce this website is a topic perhaps of least interest to a structural engineer, nonetheless, I&rsquo;d like to, if only to keep a note of the work done and changes made. But first some trivia.</p>
<p>By 2010, I was fed-up with a popular open source web publishing software I&rsquo;d been using since 2004. Its code base was changing so rapidly that I could not keep up. To quote Tom Preston-Werner, <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html" title="Blogging Like a Hacker">Blogging Like a Hacker</a> (2008):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I already knew a lot about what I didn&rsquo;t want. I was tired of complicated blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly lag behind the latest software release.</p>
<p>On Sunday, October 19th, I sat down in my San Francisco apartment with a glass of apple cider and a clear mind. After a period of reflection, I had an idea. While I&rsquo;m not specifically trained as an author of prose, I am trained as an author of code. What would happen if I approached blogging from a software development perspective? What would that look like?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 2011, fatigued by bloat and potential vulnerabilities of open source web publishing software stack, Tom&rsquo;s post was a raging fire among developers and wannabes. It kick-started static site generator revolution, and helped people realise that writing one was not some dark art that needed an army of engineers and volunteers for it to be useful.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> One could also get rid of all the complexities of running and managing database instances, and keep them from corrupting over time, be it from upgrades or from encoding.</p>
<p>These trends helped re-assess my needs too. For instance, questioning the need to use traditional web service hosts, or the need for pre-requisites like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" title="LAMP (software bundle) - Wikipedia">LAMP</a> stack to be able to host simple websites. Having such software in the cloud and shared across users amplified attack vectors for hapless publishers.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> And for what really? For the comfort of publishing on the road by accessing an archaic login system without multi-factor authentication? It&rsquo;s ridiculous in hindsight of course, but there was a time many of us thought that there really was no alternative.</p>
<p>In 2012, after years of grappling with software bloat, security gaffes, and latency of various web publishing services, I decided to take control of my publishing set-up. My objectives in maintaining control over publishing work-flow were:</p>
<ol>
<li>To write and present code, math, and prose effortlessly</li>
<li>Enable login-less and cryptographically-secure publishing</li>
<li>Ensure portability of notes together with track changes</li>
<li>Maintain bare bones, readable, safe, and low-dependency code base</li>
<li>Use a decent template engine to be able to do more with less code</li>
</ol>
<p>After some searching and evaluating, I found <a href="https://github.com/dz/chisel" title="GitHub - dz/chisel: a simple Python static blog generation utility">Chisel</a> &mdash; a simple python script to turn notes, written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="Markdown - Wikipedia">markdown</a>, into html pages, and auto-arrange them in a neatly linked structure. It employed <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/" title="Jinja">Jinja</a>, a minimalist, performant template engine; <a href="https://git-scm.com/" title="Git">git</a> for tracking changes in both notes and code; and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages | Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.">GitHub</a> for static site hosting. I subsequently <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/chisel/tree/ck" title="GitHub - ckunte/chisel at ck">added a few features</a> to Chisel I wanted for myself.</p>
<p>Both the model and the controller are local processes, having decided long ago that I would run nothing in the cloud. Only the view produced (from a combination of model and controller processes) is pushed to the host via git.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Today I am able to say that after nine years of sustained use of this above set-up, it remains very usable. The code base has remained the same, with lines of code never exceeding more than a few overall, and it is as readable today as I had first found it. The only noteworthy maintenance I undertook was in 2019-20, when concerned by the need to <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">phase out python v2</a>, I sat down to re-factor Chisel to python 3. I did so <a href="https://github.com/dz/chisel/pull/7/commits/13d3d3ee3b7ede6bd41b962f8abee0ba629578b9" title="2to3 by ckunte · Pull Request #7 · dz/chisel · GitHub">without discernible change</a> in code. </p>

<p>This was especially true for medium to low volume publishers, who were not producing 1,000+ posts a month, and who did not need to own, maintain, upgrade this web application stack on a server, stay subscribed to application security news, and patch at a moment&rsquo;s notice upon discovering vulnerabilities.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>I endured two security breaches between 2002&ndash;6, which were scary, and I realised that if I were to continue with this hobby (of writing on the web), then I could not afford to remain oblivious to the workings of web hosts or software they offered access to.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>This eliminates the need for a feature-rich web server on the host, and is therefore ideal for hosting a locally generated static site.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
