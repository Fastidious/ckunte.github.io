    <h1>Blur</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-05-28T19:43:00+08:00">21W21</time>
    <p>Another death. My cousin widowed, and their five year old orphaned. I was at their engagement fourteen years ago. </p>
    <p>The animal is tired. The mind does not know how to react. Instead, it chooses to work &mdash; to power through deliverables, code, models, and computations. Arms, legs, and the back ache hesitatingly, can&rsquo;t be sure if it is the inside temperature. The body has its way of dealing with things. In between, there&rsquo;s me in blur.</p>
    <p>We watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_(TV_series)" title="Tehran (TV series) - Wikipedia">Tehran</a> this week. Wife and I both liked. It was part cultural experience, and part curiosity.</p>

    <h1>Tai chi</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-05-09T09:39:00+08:00">21W18</time>
    <p>As we carted groceries from Coles last week, a lady saw us and remarked, &ldquo;You know what? I realise I am naked!&rdquo; She was referring to our masks. Wife replied, &ldquo;Happens to us too!&rdquo; We smiled and waved.</p>
    <p>Perth mandated wearing masks in public. This was following a handful of infections in the city. It got <a href="https://www.wa.gov.au/government/announcements/perth-and-peel-restrictions-significantly-ease-1201am-saturday-8-may" title="Perth and Peel restrictions significantly ease from 12.01am, Saturday 8 May">relaxed</a> last Saturday. So mask-on, mask-off, mask back-on is our new Tai chi routine.</p>
    <p>Concerned by the terrible situation in India, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-03/india-covid-travel-ban-australia-jail-fines-breach/100111452" title="India COVID travel ban to Australia begins today with jail and fines for those who breach it - ABC News">Australia threatened its returning citizens with jail term + fines</a>. Then, from news earlier today, that <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-09/scott-morrison-australia-coronavirus-international-borders-shut/100127142" title="Prime Minister Scott Morrison warns Australia will only open borders 'when it is safe to do so' - ABC News">&lsquo;Australia will remain locked off to the rest of the world until at least 2022&rsquo;</a>.</p>

    <p>As I read NYT&rsquo;s article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/world/asia/india-coronavirus-oxygen.html" title="Accident at Covid Hospital in India Kills at Least 22 as Cases Surge - The New York Times">India&rsquo;s health system cracks under the strain as coronavirus cases surge</a>, I am struck by the comments therein.

    <h1>Milestone: 200</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-04-11T09:20:00+08:00">21W14</time>
    <p>With its rear tire + tube bust, cable housings frayed, wife and I took my daughter&rsquo;s old bike to a local shop to be looked-at. The gentlemen at the shop said it would be cheaper to buy a new one instead. Of course.</p>
    <p>Speaking of bikes, my year-old features a cheap Shimano Tourney gear-set, and I spent the last evening thinking about replacing it. SRAM&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/mountain/series/nx-eagle?filters=&amp;sort=Relevancy&amp;page=1" title="NX Eagle">NX Eagle</a> set is the one I&rsquo;m keen on, but aside from being unsure if the bike&rsquo;s rear hub (135&times;5 QR) has sufficient room to swap a 1&times;7 with a 1&times;12 drive train, the set is as expensive as the entire bike itself!</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SACS" title="SACS - Packages - Package Control">language syntax for SACS</a>, I released last December, crossed 200 downloads this week. For a little grind outside work, I had no idea many would be interested in something like this.</p>
    <p>The other day over coffee, we discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" title="LaTeX - Wikipedia">LATEX type-setting system</a>. I offered to <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/templates/wiki/Installation" title="Installation · ckunte/templates Wiki · GitHub">help set-up</a>, to which my younger one said, &ldquo;Best if you prepare a study plan first, as you can be quite repetitive.&rdquo; The nerve! &#128522;</p>

    <h1>In plain sight</h1>

    <p>I have a lot of feelings about 2020, but I am not going to talk about&rsquo;em. Eight weeks into the new year and I feel exhausted already. I will be fifty in a year, and I ought take better care of myself. So this year, I am hoping to listen to my body, free my mind, and practice self-care.</p>
