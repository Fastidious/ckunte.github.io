    <h1>Tai chi</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-05-09T09:39:00+08:00">21W18</time>
    <p>As we carted groceries from Coles last week, a lady saw us and remarked, &ldquo;You know what? I realise I am naked!&rdquo; She was referring to our masks. Wife replied, &ldquo;Happens to us too!&rdquo; We smiled and waved.</p>
    <p>Perth mandated wearing masks in public. This was following a handful of infections in the city. It got <a href="https://www.wa.gov.au/government/announcements/perth-and-peel-restrictions-significantly-ease-1201am-saturday-8-may" title="Perth and Peel restrictions significantly ease from 12.01am, Saturday 8 May">relaxed</a> last Saturday. So mask-on, mask-off, mask back-on is our new Tai chi routine.</p>
    <p>Concerned by the terrible situation in India, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-03/india-covid-travel-ban-australia-jail-fines-breach/100111452" title="India COVID travel ban to Australia begins today with jail and fines for those who breach it - ABC News">Australia threatened its returning citizens with jail term + fines</a>. Then, from news earlier today, that <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-09/scott-morrison-australia-coronavirus-international-borders-shut/100127142" title="Prime Minister Scott Morrison warns Australia will only open borders 'when it is safe to do so' - ABC News">&lsquo;Australia will remain locked off to the rest of the world until at least 2022&rsquo;</a>.</p>

    <h1>Snippets for Vim</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-05-02T22:04:00+08:00">21W17</time>
    <p>It&rsquo;s miserable to doom-scroll. And yet hard to turn away from reading about the unfolding human catastrophe, as graphs climb. The tragedy of my compatriots dying reminds me of my own privilege that is hard to reconcile with. Now that the world is reacting with alarm, and sending the much needed help, hope to see better days.</p>
    <p>I wonder if I will ever see the tide turn towards science, and efforts towards strengthening public infrastructure. Away from religious zealotry, casteism, quackery, and authoritarianism operating in disguise.</p>
    <p>Occasionally I set aside my traditional set-up in favour of a humbler one. For all last week, I hooked-up my Raspberry Pi 3B+ to an external display and did everything I do. It was a distraction that offered much relief. The starkness of a simpler system without privileged software was immediately obvious. That in the first few hours I almost gave up. Vim is incredibly feature-rich, if only one can map and muscle-train to fire the right shortcuts and keys.</p>
    <p>Inspiration, as they say, can come from anywhere. Mine was from Gilles Castel, a student of mathematics at the University of Leuven. If his disarming post about how he <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/" title="How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim | Gilles Castel">takes notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim</a> will not make you sweat, then I do not know what will. It was fun to try, fail, try-again, and half-replicate what he does. The result is a collection of <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/templates/tree/master/vim-snippets">LaTeX snippets for Vim</a> created for my own use.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Using this, I can almost be as productive in Vim as I am in Sublime Text in writing technical reports. Here&rsquo;s a demo of snippets in action.</p>
    <video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177423/118755310-398e4980-b89b-11eb-9167-746a98af80d3.mov" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177423/118755310-398e4980-b89b-11eb-9167-746a98af80d3.mov" controls="controls" muted="muted">
    </video>

    <p>If the video feels slow, then it is because I type slowly. The modal editing is not yet hard-wired in me to be able to earn a belt, but I am getting better. One day with practice. None of this was possible without Holger Rapp&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips" title="GitHub - SirVer/ultisnips: UltiSnips - The ultimate snippet solution for Vim. Send pull requests to SirVer/ultisnips!">UltiSnips</a> and Junegunn Choi&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug" title="GitHub - junegunn/vim-plug: Minimalist Vim Plugin Manager">vim-plug</a>. I am grateful to the three Vim masters.</p>

    <p>As I read NYT&rsquo;s article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/world/asia/india-coronavirus-oxygen.html" title="Accident at Covid Hospital in India Kills at Least 22 as Cases Surge - The New York Times">India&rsquo;s health system cracks under the strain as coronavirus cases surge</a>, I am struck by the comments therein. My retired old parents living in India are dealing with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/22/india-covid-hell">India&rsquo;s descent into COVID hell</a> mostly on their own.</p>

    <h1>Milestone: 200</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-04-11T09:20:00+08:00">21W14</time>
    <p>With its rear tire + tube bust, cable housings frayed, wife and I took my daughter&rsquo;s old bike to a local shop to be looked-at. The gentlemen at the shop said it would be cheaper to buy a new one instead. Of course.</p>
    <p>Speaking of bikes, my year-old features a cheap Shimano Tourney gear-set, and I spent the last evening thinking about replacing it. SRAM&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/mountain/series/nx-eagle?filters=&amp;sort=Relevancy&amp;page=1" title="NX Eagle">NX Eagle</a> set is the one I&rsquo;m keen on, but aside from being unsure if the bike&rsquo;s rear hub (135&times;5 QR) has sufficient room to swap a 1&times;7 with a 1&times;12 drive train, the set is as expensive as the entire bike itself!</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SACS" title="SACS - Packages - Package Control">language syntax for SACS</a>, I released last December, crossed 200 downloads this week. For a little grind outside work, I had no idea many would be interested in something like this.</p>
    <p>The other day over coffee, we discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" title="LaTeX - Wikipedia">LATEX type-setting system</a>. I offered to <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/templates/wiki/Installation" title="Installation · ckunte/templates Wiki · GitHub">help set-up</a>, to which my younger one said, &ldquo;Best if you prepare a study plan first, as you can be quite repetitive.&rdquo; The nerve! &#128522;</p>

    <h1>In plain sight</h1>

    <p>I have a lot of feelings about 2020, but I am not going to talk about&rsquo;em. Eight weeks into the new year and I feel exhausted already. I will be fifty in a year, and I ought take better care of myself. So this year, I am hoping to listen to my body, free my mind, and practice self-care.</p>
