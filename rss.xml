    &lt;p&gt;Another death. My cousin widowed, and their five year old orphaned. I was at their engagement fourteen years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The animal is tired. The mind does not know how to react. Instead, it chooses to work &amp;mdash; to power through deliverables, code, models, and computations. Arms, legs, and the back ache hesitatingly, can&amp;rsquo;t be sure if it is the inside temperature. The body has its way of dealing with things. In between, there&amp;rsquo;s me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_(TV_series)&#34; title=&#34;Tehran (TV series) - Wikipedia&#34;&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; this week. Wife and I both liked. It was part cultural experience, and part curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As we carted groceries from Coles last week, a lady saw us and remarked, &amp;ldquo;You know what? I realise I am naked!&amp;rdquo; She was referring to our masks. Wife replied, &amp;ldquo;Happens to us too!&amp;rdquo; We smiled and waved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perth mandated wearing masks in public. This was following a handful of infections in the city. It got &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wa.gov.au/government/announcements/perth-and-peel-restrictions-significantly-ease-1201am-saturday-8-may&#34; title=&#34;Perth and Peel restrictions significantly ease from 12.01am, Saturday 8 May&#34;&gt;relaxed&lt;/a&gt; last Saturday. So mask-on, mask-off, mask back-on is our new Tai chi routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerned by the terrible situation in India, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-03/india-covid-travel-ban-australia-jail-fines-breach/100111452&#34; title=&#34;India COVID travel ban to Australia begins today with jail and fines for those who breach it - ABC News&#34;&gt;Australia threatened its returning citizens with jail term + fines&lt;/a&gt;. Then, from news earlier today, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-09/scott-morrison-australia-coronavirus-international-borders-shut/100127142&#34; title=&#34;Prime Minister Scott Morrison warns Australia will only open borders &#39;when it is safe to do so&#39; - ABC News&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Australia will remain locked off to the rest of the world until at least 2022&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snippets for Vim</title>

    &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s miserable to doom-scroll. And yet hard to turn away from reading about the unfolding human catastrophe, as graphs climb. The tragedy of my compatriots dying reminds me of my own privilege that is hard to reconcile with. Now that the world is reacting with alarm, and sending the much needed help, hope to see better days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if I will ever see the tide turn towards science, and efforts towards strengthening public infrastructure. Away from religious zealotry, casteism, quackery, and authoritarianism operating in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Occasionally I set aside my traditional set-up in favour of a humbler one. For all last week, I hooked-up my Raspberry Pi 3B+ to an external display and did everything I do. It was a distraction that offered much relief. The starkness of a simpler system without privileged software was immediately obvious. That in the first few hours I almost gave up. Vim is incredibly feature-rich, if only one can map and muscle-train to fire the right shortcuts and keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspiration, as they say, can come from anywhere. Mine was from Gilles Castel, a student of mathematics at the University of Leuven. If his disarming post about how he &lt;a href=&#34;https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/&#34; title=&#34;How I&#39;m able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim | Gilles Castel&#34;&gt;takes notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim&lt;/a&gt; will not make you sweat, then I do not know what will. It was fun to try, fail, try-again, and half-replicate what he does. The result is a collection of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ckunte/templates/tree/master/vim-snippets&#34;&gt;LaTeX snippets for Vim&lt;/a&gt; created for my own use.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Using this, I can almost be as productive in Vim as I am in Sublime Text in writing technical reports. Here&amp;rsquo;s a demo of snippets in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;video src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177423/118755310-398e4980-b89b-11eb-9167-746a98af80d3.mov&#34; data-canonical-src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177423/118755310-398e4980-b89b-11eb-9167-746a98af80d3.mov&#34; controls=&#34;controls&#34; muted=&#34;muted&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/video&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If the video feels slow, then it is because I type slowly. The modal editing is not yet hard-wired in me to be able to earn a belt, but I am getting better. One day with practice. None of this was possible without Holger Rapp&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips&#34; title=&#34;GitHub - SirVer/ultisnips: UltiSnips - The ultimate snippet solution for Vim. Send pull requests to SirVer/ultisnips!&#34;&gt;UltiSnips&lt;/a&gt; and Junegunn Choi&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug&#34; title=&#34;GitHub - junegunn/vim-plug: Minimalist Vim Plugin Manager&#34;&gt;vim-plug&lt;/a&gt;. I am grateful to the three Vim masters.&lt;/p&gt;
