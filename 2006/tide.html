  	<h1>Tide</h1>
  	<time datetime="2006-06-29 22:25">June 29, 2006</time>
  	<p>I was away last week visiting a remote platform complex offshore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Kalimantan">East Kalimantan</a> for business. At the end of Total-operated Senipah jetty, I checked-in at 6am in my coveralls, picked up a life vest and boarded a light and fast crew boat.</p>
<p>Given the generally benign offshore environment prevailing for most days of the year in the region, Total was perhaps the first regional operator to favour <a href="https://www.bourbonoffshore.com/en/offshore/surfers-key-players-life-offshore-oil-field">surfers</a> in lieu of the expensive helicopter operations for logistics. Surfers are high-speed boats that carry crew and light cargo on its bow.</p>
<p>This was my first taking the boat to travel around to the normally unmanned satellite offshore facilities. We were warned that the sea would be rough but I was not expecting boat transfers to become exclusive events. Everyday I&rsquo;d start with an early breakfast, gear-up, climb two floors down to the manned platform&rsquo;s landing area, and swing-in to an awaiting boat using a knotted rope. Reach a satellite platform, swing-out on to platform&rsquo;s boat landing. Carry out the survey, then back to the boat via the swing-in, and head-out to another facility. Back to the mother platform for lunch, and head out again. The routine repeated.</p>
<p>To improve personnel transfer safety and accessibility, Total developed a unique <a href="http://www.bourbonoffshore.com/en/services-and-fleet/marine-services/personnel-transport-industry-pioneer">boat landing system</a> in 80s in collaboration with Bourbon Marine. So, unlike the traditional stern-side berthing, these boats dock with their padded bows into a uniquely shaped structural boat landing frame known as the V-dock.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> From its slightly elevated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecastle">forecastle</a>, I&rsquo;d climb up the ladder, timing my boarding to coincide with the boat&rsquo;s heave.</p>

<p>Not all platforms feature these. Total had a fleet on contract. They&rsquo;d send us either an FSIV, a supply vessel, or any random vessel in the vicinity. There were times when we&rsquo;d get a supply vessel, and boarding would become a challenge. Notice the elevation of the pier on platform&rsquo;s boat landing, from which one would need to swing via the rope and land atop the small landing with rails on the vessel &mdash; next to the man waiting to catch and pull you in. Now imagine it with the vessel wobbling in all six degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Naturally with ever changing vessel heave, all the while fighting the tide to stay in position, it was hard to concentrate. I&rsquo;d stand on a barge bumper the boat kept slamming into, sending vibrations through my legs and spine as I clung to the slippery knotted rope awaiting transfer. I&rsquo;d wait for the moment when the boat and landing would nearly level, then swing and jump aboard. We did this like eight times a day for the next few days. It was exhausting. After a while you become inured to fear and it stops bothering you. You don&rsquo;t feel blood shooting through veins like the first couple of times.</p>
